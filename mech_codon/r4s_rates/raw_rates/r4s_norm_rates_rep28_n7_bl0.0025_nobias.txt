#Rates were calculated using the expectation of the posterior rate distribution
#Prior distribution is Gamma with 16 discrete categories

#SEQ: the amino acid in the reference sequence in one letter code.
#SCORE: The conservation scores. lower value = higher conservation.
#QQ-INTERVAL: the confidence interval for the rate estimates. The default interval is 25-75 percentiles
#STD: the standard deviation of the posterior rate distribution.
#MSA DATA: The number of aligned sequences having an amino acid (non-gapped) from the overall number of sequences at each position.
