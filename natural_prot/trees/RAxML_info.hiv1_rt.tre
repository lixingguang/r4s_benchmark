IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.


IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 55 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.

Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates and undetermined columns removed is printed to file /home1/02159/ds29583/r4s_benchmark/natural_prot/aln/aligned_seqs/hiv1_rt_clean_protein.fasta.reduced

Alignment has 55 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data
